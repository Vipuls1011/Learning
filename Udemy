Dear Lakshay,

I am writing to follow up on my relieving letter from Advantmed.

1st October 2024 was my last working day. During my exit formalities, I was advised that I would receive my relieving letter along with my Full & Final settlement by 20th October. When I did not receive them, I followed up on the 29th, and I was subsequently informed that they would be sent by 7th November.

Today, on 8th November, I have still not received the relieving letter. Although I received an email with the salary slip, neither was the payment credited to my account nor did I receive the relieving letter. I also have not received any updates regarding this delay.

Could you please assist me in getting the letter as soon as possible? It has been over a month since I joined my new organization, and HR team is following up regularly for the pending documentation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Kind regards,
